# In-silico Aptamer-Blocker analysis with response to a CAP-specific aptamer

The code modifies a CAP-specific aptamer and creates a complementary sequence called the blocker. The aptamer-blocker pairs
with a high blocker species and aptamer-CAP complexes are selected for further anaylsis and experimental testing.
