# Data

**It is recommended to process libraries within personal computer storage and usage.**

For this particular data generation, the DNA pool (n=40,000) was equally divided into 2 batches (n=20,000).
* Complete analysized pool
    * 1_to_20000_Analysized_Aptamer_and_Blockers
    * 20001_to_400001_Analysized_Aptamer_and_Blockers
* Final filtered pool
    * 1_to_20000_20nt_gap_46nt_probe
    * 20001_to_40000_20nt_gap_46nt_probe
